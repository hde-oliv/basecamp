## Description

Rebrand for the on-site Piscine here at the São Paulo branch due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Piscine process has become remote and only 3 weeks long, but it remains
an intensely dedicated bootcamp that covers C language, algorithms, UNIX Shell, and most importantly, human skills.

## What is 42?

It is a free programming school founded by Xavier Niel in France that has a
differentiated method, based on the student learning together with his peers instead of teachers as in traditional schools.

## Skills developed

### Hard Skills

	C: The fundamental language through 42's Cursus and, of course, of Basecamp as well,
	from the most basic, such as dealing with operators, variables, pointers, and memory allocation,
	to replicate existing standard functions.

	Shell: The first two lists are about the shell, to make you feel more familiar with the POSIX shell.
	going from basic commands to some more obscure.

	Git: All projects stay at a remote Git repository, so it's essential to learn it from the very
	first challenge.

### Soft Skills 

	Self-teaching and knowing how to ask or search: Things that are part of learning how to learn
	and part of the pedagogy of 42. Knowing how to go after content and learn together with
	your peers. And within that, you also need to know how to ask questions or do research, and this is already reflected.
	in the very meaning of the name 42.

	Empathy: To understand that everyone has their difficulties and that this
	does not invalidate anyone, and that everyone is capable of progressing. This was something
	that was exercised a lot during Basecamp.

	Dealing with time and responsibility: As there is a lot to do and time is short, learning
	how to organize your time is very important since there are events and corrections.
	with a fixed schedule, and it is necessary to have the responsibility to commit to such
	a schedule and stick to it.
